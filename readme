Activation Instructions
Multiple Computers

1. Insert into the file header.hrl the IP addresses of the secondary computers in the following manner:
-define(PC1, 'PC1@IP_ADDRESS1).
-define(PC2, 'PC2@IP_ADDRESS2).
-define(PC3,'PC3@IP_ADDRESS3').
-define(PC4, 'PC4@ IP_ADDRESS4').
2. For the main computer, insert the following into the same file: -define(Home,'home@IP_ADDRESS5').
3. For each secondary computer, open a terminal and enter the following: erl -setcookie dough -name PCn@IP_ADDRESS Where n is the computer's number and IP_ADDRESS is the same IP address as the header.hrl file.
4. For the main computer, open a terminal and enter the following: erl -setcookie dough -name home@IP_ADDRESS Where IP_ADDRESS is the same IP address as the header.hrl file.
5. In each terminal, enter the following to compile the files: c(cars).
c(sensors).
c(server).
c(communication_tower).
c(traffic_light).
c(main).
6. In the main computer enter the command: main:start().
Single Computer

1. Insert into the file header.hrl the IP address of the computer in the following manner:
-define(PC1, 'PC1@127.0.0.1').
-define(PC2, 'PC2@127.0.0.1').
-define(PC3,'PC3@127.0.0.1').
-define(PC4, 'PC4@127.0.0.1').
-define(Home,'home@127.0.0.1').
2. Open five nodes and enter the following command into four of them:
erl -setcookie dough -name PCn@IP_ADDRESS
Where n is the computer's number and IP_ADDRESS is the same IP address as the header.hrl file.
3. On the fifth node, enter the following command:
erl -setcookie dough -name home@IP_ADDRESS
Where IP_ADDRESS is the same IP address as the header.hrl file.
4. In each terminal, enter the following to compile the files:
c(cars).
c(sensors).
c(server).
c(communication_tower).
c(traffic_light).
c(main).
5. In the main computer enter the command:
main:start().
